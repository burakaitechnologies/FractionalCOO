# FractionalCOO
Turn your Zoom meetings into an intelligent partner. Fathom converts Zoom meetings into transcripts. Zapier saves the meeting ID in Google Sheets and the transcript in Google Docs. n8n extracts key data like summaries and action items, updating Sheets and Supabase. The Fractional COO uses this data to stay updated and give intelligent insights.
